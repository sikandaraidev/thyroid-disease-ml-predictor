# Thyroid Disease ML Predictor

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify thyroid conditions based on selected lab features. The focus is on a simplified, clinically meaningful prediction model built in Google Colab using Python.

## Objective

To create an intelligent helper tool that can assist in predicting possible thyroid conditions such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism using lab data. The model is designed with a focus on applicability to common testing patterns in the Pakistani healthcare context.

## Features Used
- Age
- Sex
- On thyroxine
- TSH
- T3
- TT4
- T4U
- FTI
- Referral source

## Target Classes
- Hypothyroid
- Hyperthyroid
- Normal

## Best Model
- Random Forest Classifier
- Macro F1 Score (Cross-Validated): **0.9861 Â± 0.0088**

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  
[Thyroid Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/102/thyroid+disease)

## Research Inspiration
This implementation is based on insights from the following research paper:  
[Sikandar et al., 2022 - Thyroid Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9405591/#B22-cancers-14-03914)
